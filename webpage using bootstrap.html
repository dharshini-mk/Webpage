He is credited with pioneering a genre of YouTube videos that centers on expensive stunts.His YouTube channel reached 130 million subscribers in January 2023,making it the fourth-most-subscribed on the platform.

      Donaldson began posting videos to YouTube in early 2012 at the age of 13 under the handle MrBeast6000; his early content ranged from Let's Plays to "videos estimating the wealth of other YouTubers."He went viral in 2017 after his "counting to 100,000" video earned tens of thousands of views in just a few days, and he has become increasingly popular ever since, with most of his videos gaining tens of millions of views.Over time, his style of content diversified to include challenge and donation videos that reward thousands of dollars, videos with arduous tasks or survival challenges, and original vlogs.Once his channel took off, Donaldson hired several of his childhood friends to help him run the growing brand. As of 2022, the MrBeast team is made up of 30 people, including Donaldson himself.</p>

    <div class=" container pt-5  bg-success border border-success">Youtube Career:<br><br>Donaldson uploaded his first YouTube video in February 2012, at the age of 13, under the handle "MrBeast6000"; his early content ranged from Let's Plays (mainly focused on Minecraft and Call of Duty: Black Ops II),videos estimating the wealth of other YouTubers,videos that offered tips to upcoming YouTube creators, and commentary on YouTube drama. Donaldson appeared only infrequently in these videos.In July 2013, the subscriber count of his channel, then named "That-dude", was around 240.

      In 2015 and 2016, Donaldson began to gain popularity with his "Worst intros on YouTube" series poking fun at YouTube video introductions.By mid-2016, Donaldson had around 30,000 subscribers. In fall 2016, Donaldson dropped out of East Carolina University to pursue a full-time career as a YouTuber.His mother did not approve of this and made him move out of the family home.
      
      As his channel grew, Donaldson hired four childhood friends Chris Tyson, Chandler Hallow, Garrett Ronalds, and Jake Franklin to contribute to his channel.They then contacted numerous YouTubers in order to obtain statistics of their successful videos and predicting the platform's recommendation system.Franklin left the crew in 2020; afterwards, Karl Jacobs, previously a cameraman, was promoted to take his place.</div>

    <div class="container p-3 my-2 bg-danger text-white">Rise to fame:<br><br>In January 2017, Donaldson published an almost day-long video of himself counting to 100,000.The ordeal took him 40 hours, with some parts sped up to "keep it under 24 hours."Donaldson also gained popularity during this period with stunts, such as attempting to break glass using a hundred megaphones, watching paint dry for an hour,attempting to stay underwater for 24 hours (which ended up failing due to health issues), and an unsuccessful attempt to spin a fidget spinner for a day.By 2018, Donaldson had given out $1 million through his outlandish stunts, which earned him the title of "YouTube's biggest philanthropist."

      During the PewDiePie vs T-Series rivalry in 2018, a competition to become the most-subscribed channel on YouTube, Donaldson bought billboards and numerous television and radio advertisements to help PewDiePie gain more subscribers than T-Series.During Super Bowl LIII, he bought multiple seats for himself and his team, whose shirts spelled out "Sub 2 PewDiePie."</div>
